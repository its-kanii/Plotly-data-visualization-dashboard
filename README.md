# Data Visualization Dashboard

## Task Overview
The objective of this task is to create an interactive data visualization dashboard that incorporates insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the results of the predictive modeling task. The dashboard should be designed to be user-friendly and informative, using tools such as Tableau or Plotly Dash.

### Task Objectives:
1. **Create an Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Use Tableau or Plotly Dash to create visualizations.
   - Ensure the dashboard is interactive and user-friendly.
2. **Incorporate Insights**:
   - Showcase key findings from the EDA.
   - Display the performance metrics and results of the predictive modeling task.
3. **Design Focus**:
   - Ensure the dashboard is visually appealing and easy to navigate.

## Steps to Complete the Task

### 1. Choose a Tool
- **Tableau**: A powerful tool for creating interactive dashboards with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Plotly Dash**: A Python framework for building analytical dashboards.

#### Setting Up Plotly Dash
Install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install dash pandas plotly
```

### 2. Dashboard Components
#### a. **EDA Insights**
Include visualizations such as:
- Bar charts or pie charts for categorical variables.
- Histograms or box plots for numerical variables.
- Correlation heatmaps for relationships between features.

#### b. **Predictive Modeling Results**
Include metrics and results such as:
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve.
- Visualizations of predictions (e.g., confusion matrix or classification probabilities).

#### c. **Interactivity**
- Filters for exploring subsets of the data (e.g., based on categories).
- Interactive tooltips or hover effects for deeper insights.

### 3. Design Guidelines
- Use clear headings and sections for different types of information.
- Maintain consistent color schemes and layouts.
- Ensure visualizations are appropriately labeled with titles, axes, and legends.

## Example: Using Plotly Dash
Hereâ€™s an example to get started with a simple dashboard using Plotly Dash:
```python
import dash
from dash import dcc, html
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')

# Initialize the Dash app
app = dash.Dash(__name__)

# Create visualizations
fig = px.histogram(df, x='numerical_column', title='Distribution of Numerical Column')

# Define the layout of the dashboard
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H1('Data Visualization Dashboard'),
    dcc.Graph(figure=fig)
])

# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

---

## Example: Using Tableau
1. Import your dataset into Tableau.
2. Create visualizations:
   - Drag dimensions and measures to the rows and columns to create charts.
   - Use filters to allow interactive exploration.
3. Design your dashboard:
   - Arrange visualizations on a single canvas.
   - Add text boxes, legends, and filters for clarity.

---

## Deliverables
1. A fully functional interactive dashboard.
2. Documentation or screenshots explaining the features and insights of the dashboard.
3. Exported file or link (for Tableau dashboards) or Python script (for Plotly Dash).

---

## Key Notes
- The dashboard should highlight critical insights from the EDA and predictive modeling tasks.
- Prioritize usability and aesthetics to ensure the dashboard is engaging and accessible.
